   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ytdl-sub's documentation!

   - step-by-step noob install instructions for each platform
   - pages for each prebuilt preset, showing which variables that can be overridden to do different things (i.e. episode_title)
   - new wiki walkthrough that uses the README config as a starting point, and gradually adds custom changes
   - pages for how to enable custom metadata agents for Kodi/Plex/jellyfin
   - page dedicated to explaining the structure of a config (it's only lightly touched on now, many folks struggle to understand the 'pattern' of presets/plugins/overrides)
