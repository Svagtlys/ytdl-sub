Rename presets to "Name Here"
Have new name for presets inheret the old ones

Each preset type, i.e. TV Show by Date should have one (which includes Kodi/Plex/Jellyfin), TV Show Collection separate, music ones separated

for helpers, Maybe grouped, like 'video quality' for those
bulk_initial_download probably needs its own page
