Prebuilt preset conventions:

"Name Here"
  - Should be 100% plug and play, and should represent the most common uses of ytdl-sub
  - One version for each of the 3 supported players (Kodi, jellyfin, plex)
  - For each of the main sources (youtube, soundcloud, bandcamp)

name_here
  - Should provide minor add-ons/adjustments to already working presets
  - Can't be used stand-alone

_name_here
  - For behind the scenes presets that aren't expected to be in common use
